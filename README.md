This mod replaces resource (like doubloons, credits) icons with older version styles (before 0.11.6).

If you still like the old icons, this is what you want!

These icons include: 
Small icons for Coal,Steel,Free XP,Ship XP,Commander XP,paragonXP,Doubloons and Credits.

Larger icons for resources displayed during missions and when opening containers.

Old style signal flag.

Removed the black background for the amount of resources.
